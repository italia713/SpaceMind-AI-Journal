Project Overview
The Astronaut Virtual Companion (AVC) leverages cutting-edge AI to engage with astronauts on an emotional and practical level. Using natural language processing, the AVC is designed to understand, respond, and adapt to an astronaut's emotional states and needs.

Key features include:
Natural, Empathetic Dialogue: The AVC uses Gemini AI for realistic conversational abilities, responding to astronaut inquiries and providing comforting companionship.
Emotion Detection: By analyzing the emotional undertones of conversations, the AVC adjusts its responses, offering personalized and empathetic dialogue.
Health Monitoring: The companion can track health status and offer reminders, alerts, and suggestions based on predefined health data.
Seamless Integration: The AVC connects with a PyQt5 interface, offering a user-friendly experience with Gemini AI API integration for conversation and emotion processing.

Technologies Used
Gemini AI: Provides the backbone for the AVC's natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
Python & PyQt5: A flexible framework that powers the GUI, enabling smooth communication between the astronaut and the virtual companion.
API Integration: Connection with Gemini AI APIs for real-time emotion analysis and dialogue adaptation.
